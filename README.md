## Meridian UWP
Meridian is a music player which allows you to listen to music from popular russian social network [vk.com](https://vk.com). It communicates with some additional services like [deezer.com](http://deezer.com) and [last.fm](http://last.fm) to bring to you some advanced features: recommendations, artists and albums search and other.
This is the UWP version for Windows 10. The source code for WPF desktop version can be found [here](https://github.com/Stealth2012/meridian).
